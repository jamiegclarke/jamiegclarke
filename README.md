### Hi ⭐️

I'm Jamie (he/him), a Cyber Security Master's student at [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/computer-science/) 👨🏻‍💻. I recently graduated from Cardiff Univesity with a first class honours BSc in Computer Science. Ahead of my Master's I am learning, creating and developing my portfolio. I am trying to program cleaner and neater code using the skills that I have learned throughout my degree. Here, I share the code for my coursework, projects and practice 💻 

I program mostly in python, java and swift but are experimenting and learning in different languages and disiplines of software. I am looking for advice on how to improve and create better code 🪐
