### Hi ⭐️

I'm Jamie (he/him), an Artifical Intelligence Master's student at [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/computer-science/) 👨🏻‍💻. I recently graduated from Cardiff Univesity with a first class honours BSc in Computer Science. Ahead of my Master's I am learning, creating and developing my portfolio. I am trying to program cleaner and neater code using the skills that I have learned throughout my degree. Here I share the code for my coursework, projects and practice 💻 ![This is an image](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQHltoec108gtQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1656778958437?e=1667433600&v=beta&t=NWVAZWVYxg9m_mXArQrI1-q1wppfM9SwnBKkJmw4nPU)

I program mostly in python, java and swift but are experimenting and learning in different languages and disiplines of software. I am to advice on how to improve and create better code 🪐
